    <h3>What is the Lightning Network?</h3>
    <p>
      Before you start using Blixt Wallet, it's good idea to get familiarized with terms, procedures, features etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's good idea to start reading and get some basic knowledge about LN and how to use it, otherwise it will be
      difficult for you as new user, to understand what are you doing with Blixt Wallet as a node LN wallet.
    </p>
    <p>Here are some resources to start learning:</p>

  <section id="fees">
    <h3>What fees are used? Is there a cost to use LN channels?</h3>
    <p>1. Blixt Wallet itself do not charge any fees for usage of the app.</p>
    <p>
      2. Use of Lightning Network (LN) is <i>not free</i>. This is a myth. Even if the cost of using LN is really small,
      there is a cost and some users will look at that cost too.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Opening and closing channels on LN <i>have a cost</i>. and sometimes it's not cheap. It depends also of the
      miner fees in the moment of opening a LN channel. Sometimes can be high, sometimes can be really cheap. Users
      should first learn about how these things works. Here is
      <a href="https://bitcoin.cipix.eu/en/what-is-mempool/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
        a simple guide about mempool fees.</a>
      Here is another
      <a href="https://suredbits.com/lightning-101-lightning-network-fees/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
        guide about LN fees</a>.
    </p>

    <h4>USE CASE SCENARIO:</h4>
    <p>You are a new Blixt Wallet user and you just installed the app, you have no funds deposited into the wallet.</p>
    <p>
      Let's consider you choose to use Dunder LSP service (<a href="#blixt-lsp">see down below how it works and what is
        LSP</a>), just to deposit 100k sats into your Blixt LN wallet.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the moment LSP service received your 100k deposit, it will use it those 100k sats to open a 400k channel
      (amount can vary,
      <a href="https://dunder.blixtwallet.com/ondemand-channel/service-status" target="_blank"
        rel="noopener noreferrer">
        see here more details
      </a>
      ) towards your wallet. So you will have 100k sats as outbound liquidity and a 300k sats inbound liquidity. But
      that opening has a cost: onchain fees for the tx and also a commit fee (reserve kept for closing the channel).
      See more details about commit fees here:

        rel="noopener noreferrer">
        Link 3</a>.
    </p>
    <!-- Section needs some rework
    <p>
      So when the channel is open, you will see in its details that from 100k sats, there's a 5-10k sats "not available"
      to spend, is as "reserved". You end up with only 99k sats for spending.
    </p>
    <p>
      That's why is important NOT to open small channels like 10-20-30-50-100k sats. Is not rentable because it will be
      eaten in fees. A 500k-1M-2M sats channel is much recommended because then those commit fees will be small in
      regards of the size of channel.
    </p>
    <p>
      For using small amount of sats, there are many other LN wallet apps, including custodial that can deal with this
      aspect in another way and cheaper:

  <section id="blixt-node">
    <h3>How is it possible to have a node on a mobile device?</h3>
    <p>
      Blixt Wallet uses the lightning node implementation
      <a href="https://github.com/LightningNetwork/lnd/issues" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
        lnd</a>
      and the
      <a href="https://suredbits.com/neutrino-what-is-it-and-why-we-need-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
        Bitcoin SPV client Neutrino</a>
      directly on the phone. Lnd has been configured to work well on mobile devices.
    </p>
    <!---
      <p>
        Also Blixt can use Tor network so you can have more privacy and usage for incoming LN channels from other nodes,
        having an unique onion address for your node URI. Here you can read more about BTC/LN Tor nodes,
        <a href="https://blog.lopp.net/tor-only-bitcoin-lightning-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
          an article writen by Jamesson Lopp
        </a>
      </p>
      -->
    <p>
      Keep in mind that Blixt Wallet is a Lightning node, with LN channels as any other node. That means that in
      order to be able to transact on LN, you need to be online, connected, in the moment of transaction. If you do
      not transact, it's not really necessary to stay online. Blixt, once is open it will take few moments to re-sync
      the latest blocks through SPV Neutrino and you will be back online. On the other hand, for transacting onchain
      (not LN) it's not necessary to be online.

  <section id="connect-bitcoin-node">
    <h3>How do I connect Blixt Wallet to my own full node?</h3>
    <p>Under <i>Settings -> Bitcoin -> Set Bitcoin node</i> you can enter a bitcoin node to connect to</p>
    <p>
      Blixt Wallet does not yet support
      <a href="https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/issues/4973" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tor
        onion v3</a>, so for the moment, you can use your node only if it's "visible" on clearnet (IP/domain), you
      must make sure
      that Bitcoin's P2P port (8333) is forwarded by your router. You can connect to your node via its local LAN IP,
      but it will then only work if you're connected to your home router.
    </p>
    <p>
      BIP157 compact filter indexing must be enabled for your node, add this to your bitcoin.conf, if it isn't already
      set:
    </p>
    <pre>
blockfilterindex=1
peerblockfilters=1</pre>
    <!-- To be enabled once lnd got onion v3 support -->
    <!--
    <p>When LND will support Tor v3 for Neutrino, you will be abble to connect via the onion service of your node.</p>
    <p>For example, for Umbrel nodes (most popular), this onion address is NOT the regular node URI onion address. You will go to Umbrel dashboard - connect wallet - select Bitcoin P2P and copy that onion address. No port is necessary, by default is 8333. Paste that onion address into Blixt - settings - Bitcoin node. Restart Blixt (force close/restart if is not restarting automatically. Then wait to sync. You can check the status in settings - LND logs or just click on sync icon on main screen.</p>

    <h3>Can I remotely control an Umbrel from Blixt Wallet?</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Blixt Wallet</strong> is a fully fledged lightning node in of itself. It's not possible connect and
      control a remote node.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rather than controlling your node at your home, enable to Tor and open a channel towards it.

    <h3>
      I lost my mobile phone (dead, stolen) or simply want to migrate to a new phone, what is the procedure?
    </h3>
    </summary>
    <p>
      RULE NO.1 - You should always have made a channel backup kept it into a safe place (eg,
      password manager). If you did that, the procedure is simple and you have two ways (fast and slow) and also two
      situations to take in consideration (you had funds in onchain or not).
    </p>
    <p>
      RULE NO.2 - Never use a full backup of a device as a restored backup for BTC/LN wallets. This can end up in
      losing funds, by broadcasting a wrong state of channels.
    </p>
    <p>
      NOTE NO.1 - Migration (or funds restore procedure) means creating a new Node ID and move the restored funds to
      it. This is a better procedure for privacy, safety of funds and easiest way.
    </p>
    <p>
      NOTE NO.2 - if you still have the original DEVICE still working and online with funds in LN channels, NEVER do
      the restore procedure on a new device with channels restore options. This action will force close the existing
      channels and you could get a penalty for that (broadcasting twice the status of channels). You can restore on
      another device, keeping the original still open, ONLY the onchain wallet/seed, but never put the channels
      backup.
    </p>
    <p>
      NOTE NO.3 - After restore process is started and if you do not see in "Lightning Channels" menu that the old
      channels enters in status "closing" and are not there at all, it is safe to start again the process to restore
      from backup file. No need to start over from zero with also onchain restore. If your onchain wallet is restored
      and funds are back, is OK, just continue with LN channels restore.
    </p>
    <p>
      NOTE NO.4 - If you restore LN channels that were open using Tor network, then BEFORE starting the restore
      process, go to top right corner and activate Tor. In that way, your Blixt node could "see" the Tor peers and
      start the closing procedure in normal way.
    </p>
    <h4>Scenario A - migrate Blixt to a new device (fast way)</h4>
    <p>Conditions:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>you still have the old device functional</li>
      <li>you have a new device ready with Blixt Wallet already installed (but not started yet)</li>
      <li>you have funds ONLY into LN channels, the onchain is empty</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Procedure:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        create a new Blixt wallet instance on the new device (new seed) and save that seed into a safe place (password
        manager)
      </li>
      <li>wait for Blixt to sync (takes just few minutes), you will see the sync icon on top that disappear</li>
      <li>on the new device, go to Blixt settings - activate "Dunder LSP"</li>
      <li>
        on the new device, go to main screen and click on "receive" button and create a new LN invoice to open a
        Dunder LSP channel
      </li>
      <li>
        put the amount of total balance available displayed on the old device Blixt (main screen), then press create
        invoice
      </li>
      <li>
        with the old device Blixt, scan that LN invoice QR code and pay it. The old wallet will send all available
        funds to the new one and Dunder will open new channel for you, with that amount
      </li>
      <li>it will take just few minutes until tx is confirmed and channel open on the new device, be patient.</li>
      <li>
        once you see the funds in the new device available, it is recommended to close those old empty channels. If
        there are some residual satoshis, it will come back to onchain wallet and can be sent later to the new device,
        using an onchain tx
      </li>
      <li>DONE! Now is safe to wipe Blixt from the old device and funds are safe into the new one</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Scenario B - old device is lost, non-functional or non-recoverable (slow way)</h4>
    <p>Conditions:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>you do not have the old device anymore</li>
      <li>you have a new device ready with Blixt Wallet already installed (but not started yet)</li>
      <li>you have funds into LN channels but also in the onchain wallet</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Procedure:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Install Blixt Wallet into a new phone</li>
      <li>
        In the first screen to create or restore wallet, got to top right corner and activate Tor (if you had
        previously channels open with Tor nodes).
      </li>
      <li>
        Blixt will restart in Tor mode. Then click on "restore". Fill in your 24 words seed from old wallet, space
        delimited. Add also the channels.backup file you save it previously and copy it into your new phone
        memory. Optionally, you can use Google drive, if you have it there.
      </li>
      <li>Click "restore" and wait for the app to do the standard procedure for recovering the funds.</li>
      <li>
        Blixt will close the existing channels and after min 40 blocks funds will be recovered and visible into your
        onchain wallet. So be patient.
      </li>
      <li>
        To check the funds, go to main screen, top drawer and enter into onchain wallet. On top right corner you click
        en see the txs log. After channels were closed and txs confirmed, locktime expired, you will see the funds in
        tgere.
      </li>
    </ul>

      <summary>
        <h3 style="color: Orange">Can I use auto-pilot to open channels for me?</h3>
      </summary>
      <p>
        Yes. Blixt have the auto-pilot feature, but is used only once, first time you create the Blixt node wallet and
        you deposit to onchain QR code that appear first time on the main screen. That will open a channel from Blixt
        public node towards your Blixt mobile node, with the amount you deposited (minus the fees and reserves for the
        channel).
      </p>
      <p>
        You just have to activate the option in Blixt - Settings - "automatically open channels". This feature, is not
        used anymore, once the first channel is open. You have the other way, using Dunder LSP channels (<a
          href="#blixt-lsp">see previous FAQ item about Dunder LSP</a>), or simply open channels with funds from your
        onchain wallet towards any other LN node. You can check on
        <a href="https://amboss.space" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LN nodes explorer page Amboss.space</a>
        and choose a LN node that you whish to connect.
